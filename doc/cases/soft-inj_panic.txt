Overall:

- Test method
  * Add cases/soft-inj/panic/cases.sh into configuration file, and invoke
    a test driver on it.
- Common
  * Test script of test cases in this file can be found in
    cases/soft-inj/panic/cases.sh

1. fatal

- Objective:
  * Test MSR read logic of MCE handler
  * Test synchronization between monarch and subject
  * Test logic to recognize a fatal (PCC) MCE
- Code path tested:
  * do_machine_check() until mce_sync_monarch/subject()
  * mce_sync_monarch()
  * mce_sync_subject()
  * mce_reign() until mce_panic("Fatal machine check",)
  * mce_severity()
  * mce_timeout() except if (*t <= 0) branch
  * mce_panic()
  * print_mce()
  * mce_log()
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/panic/data/fatal
- Expected result:
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * Kernel panic message is "Fatal machine check"


2. fatal with timeout

- Objective:
  * Test logic of timeout during monarch/subject synchronization
- Code path tested:
  * do_machine_check() from mce_sync_monarch/subject() to
    mce_panic("Machine check",);
  * mce_timeout() if (*t <= 0) branch
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/panic/data/fatal_timeout
- Expected result:
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * Kernel panic message is "Machine check"
  * Timeout message in kernel log


3. fatal in irq

- Objective:
  * Test fatal MCE occur in IRQ context
- Code path tested:
  * Same as fatal
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/panic/fatal_irq
- Expected result:
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * Kernel panic message is "Fatal machine check"

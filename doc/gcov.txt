- Make sure your kernel has gcov support. You can find lasted kernel
  gcov patches from:
      http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/gcov.php

  A README for kernel gcov can be found from:
      http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/gcov/readme.php

  Notes: CONFIG_GCOV_ALL does not work for me. Add the line
      EXTRA_CFLAGS += $(KBUILD_GCOV_FLAGS)
  to the respective Makefiles are more stable.

- Make sure gcov is available in you system. It comes with gcc package
  normally. If kdump test driver is used, a tool named gcovdump is
  also needed to dump *.gcda from crash dump image.

- In test config, make sure the following setting is available:

      # enable GCOV support
      GCOV=1
      # kernel source is needed to get gcov graph
      KSRC_DIR=<kernel srouce directory>

- After testing, *.c.gcov will be generated in test case result
  directory, such as results/soft-inj/non-panic/corrected/mce_64.c.gcov.

- To merge gcov graph data from several test cases, a tool named
  gcov_merge.py in tools sub-directory can be used. For example,

      tools/gcov_merge results/soft-inj/*/*/mce_64.c.gcov

  Will output merged gcov graph from all test cases under
  soft-inj. This can be used to check coverage of several test cases.

	* cases/simple/driver.sh: add support to fake panic(delete kernel
	  log after first fake panic)
	* cases/simple/driver.sh: add support to execute a background
	  program. This can be used to run such as LTP in background and
	  run mce-test simultaneously to trigger more regressions.

	* overall: add simple description at top of most files
	* README: add README
	* drivers/simple/driver.sh: add random sleep between cases

	* drivers/simple/driver.sh: with the help of fake panic kernel
	  patch, simple driver can be used to test most cases effectively.
	* Makefile: add a target test to trigger most common used tests
	* tools/mce-inject: support injecting multiple
	  corrected/uncorrected MCE simultaneously
	* tools/mce-inject: support specifying CPU context of MCE injecting
	* cases: add several test cases, mostly combination of non-panic
	  cases
